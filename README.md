# render-cli-alpha

This is the alpha version of the Render CLI. It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for general use. 

## Installation

### Building from source

To build the Render CLI from source, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. You can install Go by following the [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once you have Go installed, you can build the Render CLI by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:render-oss/render-cli-alpha.git
cd render-cli-alpha
go build -o render
```

This will create a binary called `render` in the current directory. You can move this binary to a directory in your `PATH` to make it easier to use.
